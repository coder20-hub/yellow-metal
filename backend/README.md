# Backend Services

## ⚠️ Important Note

**The backend is currently NOT REQUIRED.**

The frontend application is fully self-contained and uses mock data for all functionality.

## 🔮 Future Use

This backend folder is reserved for future API integration when you want to:
- Connect to a real database
- Implement authentication
- Add payment processing
- Integrate with third-party services

## 📦 Current Status

- ✅ Frontend: Fully working with mock data
- ⏸️ Backend: Placeholder for future development

## 🚀 If You Want to Develop Backend Later

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Add your server code (Express, NestJS, etc.)
npm run dev
```

For now, just use the frontend!
